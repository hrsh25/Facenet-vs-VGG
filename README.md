# Facenet-vs-VGG

# Project Overview:

Face recognition has always been challenging topic for both science and fiction. A woman has her hair dyed or worn a hat to to disguise. Deep learning tasks usually expect to be fed multiple instances of a custom class to learn (e.g. lots of pictures of someone). This makes face recognition task satisfactory because training should be handled with limited number of instances – mostly one shot of a person exists. Moreover, adding new classes should not require reproducing the model. Basically, we will apply transfer learning and use pre-trained weights of Facenet and Oxford’s VGG (Visual Geometry Group) to analyze the performance of these models on IMFDB (Indian Movie Face DataBase). 

# Project Description:

•	Download the IMFDB Dataset.

•	Clone Facenet and VGG models from Github.

•	Apply required changes in the code for Facenet so that it gives output for your dataset.

•	Similarly, apply required changes in the code for VGG so that it gives output for your dataset. 

•	Give an image as input to the model.

•	Display bar graphs displaying the analysis of accuracy of both algorithms.
